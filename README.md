Data Validation & Cleaning
Missing Values Handling:

Columns affected: calories, carbohydrate, sugar, and protein had missing values.

Solution: Missing values were replaced with column mean to maintain data consistency.

servings had some non-numeric values ("4 as a snack", "6 as a snack").

Solution: Converted to numeric and replaced invalid values with the median.

High Traffic was provided as "High" and "Low", converted to binary encoding (1 = High, 0 = Low).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations Used:

Box Plot for calories and servings (to detect outliers).

Scatter Plot between carbohydrates and protein (to check relationships).

Heatmap (correlation matrix to find feature relationships).

Findings:

Recipes with higher protein and lower sugar tend to be more popular.

Certain categories (e.g., Breakfast, One Dish Meals) had a higher proportion of high-traffic recipes.

Model Development
Problem Type:

This is a binary classification problem (high_traffic: 1 or 0).

Models Used:

Baseline Model: Logistic Regression

Comparison Model: Random Forest

Code for Model Fitting:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

Splitting the dataset
X = df.drop(columns=['recipe', 'category', 'high_traffic']) y = df['high_traffic'] X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Scaling the data
scaler = StandardScaler() X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train) X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

Logistic Regression Model
log_model = LogisticRegression() log_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train) y_pred_log = log_model.predict(X_test_scaled) recall_log = recall_score(y_test, y_pred_log)

Random Forest Model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42) rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train) y_pred_rf = rf_model.predict(X_test) recall_rf = recall_score(y_test, y_pred_rf)

print(f'Logistic Regression Recall: {recall_log:.4f}') print(f'Random Forest Recall: {recall_rf:.4f}')

Model Evaluation
Since the business goal is 80% recall, Logistic Regression meets the requirement (98.23%), whereas Random Forest (77.88%) does not.

Business Metrics & Recommendations
Metric to Monitor:

Recall should remain above 80% for predicting popular recipes.

Track precision to balance avoiding unpopular recipe misclassification.

Final Recommendations:

Use Logistic Regression for selecting homepage recipes.

Monitor model performance and update regularly with new data.

Optimize recipe selection based on ingredient trends and user engagement data.
